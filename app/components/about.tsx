    { q: "How do HELOC draw and repayment periods work?", a: "The draw period (typically 5-10 years) allows you to access funds. The repayment period follows where you pay back principal and interest." },
    { q: "Can I consolidate high-interest debt with a cash-out refinance?", a: "Yes, a cash-out refinance allows you to tap into your home equity to pay off credit cards, personal loans, and other high-interest debts." },
    { q: "What costs should I expect at closing?", a: "Closing costs typically range from 2-5% of the loan amount and include appraisal fees, title insurance, origination fees, and more." },
    { q: "Will I have to pay mortgage insurance (PMI)?", a: "PMI is required on conventional loans with less than 20% down. FHA loans have mortgage insurance premiums (MIP) for the life of the loan." },
    { q: "How does Billy monitor rates for me after closing?", a: "I provide ongoing rate monitoring and will reach out if refinancing becomes beneficial based on market conditions." }

                My journey into mortgage lending and real estate finance was forged through diverse experiences that shaped my unique, client-first approach to home financing. Raised with the grounded values of small-town Missouri, I learned the importance of community trust and financial integrity—principles that guide every loan application and refinance consultation.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                That foundation was solidified during my service in the US Navy, where I embraced discipline and meticulous attention to detail in high-stakes environments. These military-honed skills translate directly to mortgage underwriting precision and loan processing excellence. After my service, I graduated from the University of Houston and built a 20+ year career in finance, spanning residential lending, commercial property financing, tax planning, and financial audit.

                This comprehensive expertise in debt-to-income analysis, credit evaluation, and loan structuring allows me to navigate complex financing scenarios from first-time homebuyer FHA loans to sophisticated DSCR investment property acquisitions. Whether you're seeking a conventional purchase loan, VA mortgage benefits, jumbo financing, or exploring cash-out refinance options, my background in both residential and commercial lending ensures you receive expert guidance tailored to your specific homeownership goals and investment objectives.
